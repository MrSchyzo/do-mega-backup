# Do MEGA Backup
Docker image to snapshot MEGA folders in local

## What's this?
It's just a Docker image used to connect to MEGA and create periodic snapshot of the entire remote folder.

## What's with the name?
You have alternatives to interpret the string "domegabackup"
1. "Do MEGA Backup": self explanatory
2. "D.O. MEGA Backup": Docker Operator MEGA Backup
3. dOmegaBackup: docker Omega Backup, just because greek letters are cool in names

## Can it be of use for others?
I hope so, but I don't expect it to be that useful.
